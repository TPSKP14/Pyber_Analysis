# Pyber_Analysis

Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

The purpose of the analysis was to disect different cities and areas of the pyber business and break them into categories to analyze.  We broke the data down by city type, driver count, fare and ride id amoung other categories.  In the end we broke it down to a weekly analysis, unfortunately I could no purpose my code correctly to break it down to a weekly basis which made it difficult to assess the total data frame. 

Ultimately because of the error in the code it was difficult to fully asses the data.  From what I could tell, it was evident that both the largest concentration of drivers and rides is in the urban environments, followed by suburban, followed by the rural environment.  The average fare seemed higher in the rural areas, though the urban areas had a much higher concentration in the urban environment.

A multiple line chart would have been very helpful to ultimately view all of the data accurately.  I will continue to work on the chart after submission to find the error in my code.
